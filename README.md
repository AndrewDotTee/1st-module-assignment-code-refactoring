**THE INTRODUCTION:**

Module 1's assignment entails refactoring the Horiseon Social Solution Services incorporated website to further improve accessibility for new and returning clients and additionally enhance search engine optimisation through refactoring the source code and related keywords.

**THE OBJECTIVES:**

- The website meets accessibility standards via desktop.
- During inspection of the HTML & CSS code, semantic elements are present.
- Alt attributes are accessible.
- Headings are in sequential order.
- A descriptive title is present.

**ALTERATIONS TO HTML SOURCE:**

- Added <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> for better responsiveness.
- Changed the <div> for the header to <header> for better semantic representation.
- Changed the <div> for the hero section to <section> for a more semantic structure.
- Changed the <div> for the content section to <section> for better semantics.
- Changed the <div> for each service to <article> for better representation of each section.
- Updated the image tags with the alt attribute for better accessibility.
- Changed the <div> for the benefits section to <section> for better semantics.
- Changed the <div> for each benefit to <article> for better representation of each section.
- Changed the <div> for the footer to <footer> for better semantic representation.

**ALTERATIONS TO CSS SOURCE:**

1) Semantic HTML Elements:
Introduced semantic HTML elements such as header, nav, article and footer for better structure and readability.

2) Grouping Styles by Section:
Organised styles based on the sections of the HTML document with the header, hero, content, benefits, service sections and footer.

3) Styling Specific Elements:
Applied styles to specific HTML elements within sections for h1, nav, ul, li, img, h2, h3 for a more targeted, modular styling.

4) Consistent Naming and Formatting:
Ensured consistent naming conventions and formatting for better code maintenance.

**REMARKS:**

The purpose of modifying the HTML & CSS source code is to improve the code's semantics, structure and accessibility in contrast to the original source code provided.
